Even if it did, CSS3 does not support\n * proportional height and width for containers that are sized by `fit-content`. Subsequently, we need to\n * calculate our own circle sizing.\n *\n * Ideally, we would fit as many words as we can per chord of the circle, with lines closer to the center\n * being wider than lines at the top or bottom. It would be very expensive to calculate the minimum radius for\n * hundreds or thousands of nodes that each have multiple words and therefore many possible chords.\n *\n * Instead, a much cheaper compromise is to calculate the smallest circle that contains one or two (depending\n * on if the operation is rendered) vertically-stacked, horizontally-centered rectangle(s).\n *\n * For one rectangle, the radius would be half of the diagonal of the rectangle.\n *\n * For two rectangles, we know the center would be on a line that vertically bisects the two given rectangles.\n * Which means we know cx.\n * The center should also be equidistant from the bottom left corner of the lower rectangle, and the top right\n * corner of the upper rectangle.\n * Which means we can calculate cy based on the widths and heights of the two rectangles.\n * With cx,cy and one point on the circle, such as the lower left corner of the lower rectangle, we can\n * calculate the radius.\n * One caveat: if cy is too low, the circle will not include the upper corners of the lower rectangle, or if\n * cy is too high, the circle will not include the lower corners of the upper rectangle.\n * In this case, the circle must be enlarged to fully encompass the overflowing rectangle, and the circle\n * would instead be exclusively based on that rectangle.\n *\n * There are multiple different rectangles that can be formed to contain a string. These are calculated by\n * calcRects. All different combinations of service and operation rectangles are used to calculate the\n * smallest radius containing both.\n */\n\nimport _memoize from 'lodash/memoize';\n\nimport { FONT, FONT_SIZE, LINE_HEIGHT, OP_PADDING_TOP, WORD_RX } from './constants';\n\ntype TRect = { height: number; width: number };\n\nlet svcSpan: HTMLSpanElement | undefined;\n\n/*\n * Mesaurements for the words comprising a service are measured by a span that is mounted out of a view.\n * Using a canvas would remove the requirement that the measuring container is part of the DOM, however canvas\n * measurements proved to be inaccurate by small yet impactful margins.
